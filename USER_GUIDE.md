## üîê Security Features

### For Voters

**Your vote is:**

- ‚úÖ **Anonymous** - Your identity is hashed and cannot be traced
- ‚úÖ **Immutable** - Once cast, votes cannot be changed or deleted
- ‚úÖ **Verifiable** - Use your receipt to verify your vote on the blockchain

   - Encryption uses PBKDF2 key derivation with 100,000 iterations
   - Only the poll creator can decrypt votes after closing

3. **Blockchain Storage**
   - Encrypted vote stored in a block
   - Block is mined with proof-of-work
   - Block is linked to previous blocks (immutable chain)
